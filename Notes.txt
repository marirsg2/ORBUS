PLOT the slopes with the standard error of the features.

When computing the variance of the output, use all possible combinations of upper middle and lower bound of the features.
OR maybe have 3 models, HIGHEST value of weights (also means least negative!! yes, not just magnitude). normal, and
lowest magnitude of weights (smallest positive). THIS GIVES THE OUTPUT BOUNDS
