Title: Let me learn what you really want : AL of preferences based on expected output value

----------------------

The

!! v2 works with gaussian !! ?? more tail, more effect ? test with gumbel

BECAUSE of the interconnected nature of the data.
TWO GROUPS you may see a difference
Then add an intersection variable, and vary the frequency of it. Bottle neck of the info flow.
Then have 3 groups of variables, with


v1) F_beta should have beta between 1 and 2 ? or problem specific. If uniform distribution, then lower ?? if gaussian or gumbel
then weight it higher. TEST theory that gain based sampling provides support for high weight features more than low weight features.

v2) var + var^g should be compared with F_beta
USE TWO GROUPS. Use gaussian

----------------------

@ Groups of smaller features that add up make us better ? shows the benefit of non-blind variance search.

@ try the other gain function

@ larger features

----------------------
========FUTURE WORK
1) ERROR/value loss can be used in NN too !! selective training for accuracy. Ignore features that occur in weaker regions.
        FOCUS ON FEATURES THAT CONTRIBUTE MORE !! NN-regression.
2) Add in F_beta score for sampling the data points.
