What is missing.



MLE error is NOT being done correctly. The bayes error was being used. WHY ?
I apparently said that the error was in the bayes error list

BETTER FEATURE DISCOVERY:

If a plan has no features, it's base score is zero ?? check.
This makes it hard to discover features unless each plan has a lot of features. if it has 8 features per plan,
then it would discover more of the features. Else it is likely to find plans with no undiscovered features
