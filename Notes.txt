Title: Let me first learn what you really want : AL of preferences based on expected output value

----------------------
PLOT the slopes with the standard error of the features.

When computing the variance of the output, use all possible combinations of upper middle and lower bound of the features.
OR maybe have 3 models, HIGHEST value of weights (also means least negative!! yes, not just magnitude). normal, and
lowest magnitude of weights (smallest positive). THIS GIVES THE OUTPUT BOUNDS

-------------

FOR VARIANCE COMPUTATION: Store weights in a set. weights of different t-values. THEN sample weights from this set to get a model
to estimate the prediction. Sample many weights , to get many models. compute mean and variance. COMPARE with your simplistic approach.
